# There are 2 important parameter to the Kneighbors classifier : 
	1. no . of neighbors 
	2. distance between data points 

# In practise using small number of neighbors like 3 to 5 works well , but not every case . 

# One of the strengths of kNN is that model is very easy to understand , and often gives resonable performance without a lot of adjustments 

# Building nearest neighbors model is very fast but hwne the training set is very large prediction will be very slow . 

# KNN will not work well on datasets with many features (hundreds or more) .
